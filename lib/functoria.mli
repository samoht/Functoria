(** The Functoria DSL.

    The Functoria DSL allows users to describe how to create portable
    and flexible applications. It allows to pass application
    parameters easily using command-line arguments either at
    configure-time or at runtime.

    Users of the Functoria DSL composes their application by defining
    a list of {{!foreign}module} implementations, specify the
    command-line {!keys} that are required and {{!combinators}combine}
    all of them together using
    {{:http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0956796807006326}applicative}
    operators.

    The DSL expression is then compiled into an {{!app}application
    builder}, which will, once evaluated, produced the final portable
    and flexible application.

(** [type t] is a value representing the module type [t]. *)

val (@->): 'a typ -> 'b typ -> ('a -> 'b) typ
(** Construct a functor type from a type and an existing functor
    type. This corresponds to prepending a parameter to the list of
    functor parameters. For example:

    {[ kv_ro @-> ip @-> kv_ro ]}

    This describes a functor type that accepts two arguments -- a
    [kv_ro] and an [ip] device -- and returns a [kv_ro].

(** {1:app Application Builder}

    Values of type {!impl} are tied to concrete module implementation
    with the {!foreign} construct. Module implementations of type
    {!job} can then be {{!Functoria_app.Make.register}registered} into
    an application builder. The builder is in charge if parsing the
    command-line arguments and of generating code for the final
    application. See {!Functoria_app} for details. *)
